1. Start the SSH Agent
The first step is to ensure the SSH agent is running. You can start the SSH agent with the following command:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
This command initializes the SSH agent and sets the necessary environment variables.

2. Add SSH Keys to the Agent
Once the SSH agent is running, you need to add your SSH keys to it. Use the following command to add your default SSH key:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
If your key has a different name or location, replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the appropriate path.

3. Ensure Proper Environment Variables
Ensure that the environment variables SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID are set correctly. These variables are automatically set by ssh-agent, but you can verify them with:

echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
echo $SSH_AGENT_PID
If these variables are empty or incorrect, re-run the command to start the SSH agent (eval "$(ssh-agent -s)").

4. Automate SSH Agent Start and Key Addition
To automate the process of starting the SSH agent and adding keys, you can add the following lines to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc):

# Start the SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH keys
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
