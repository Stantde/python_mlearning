I. Chapter 1: Acquiring Financial Data
	* This is super important as the analysis can only be as good as the data supplied.
	* Be sure to read the docs as vendors may include additional information.
	* Data can come in the form of .csv, JSON, and pd dataframes. The goal is to prepare for data in any form.
	A. Getting data from Yahoo Finance
		* Beta - a measure of the volatility of an individual asset in comparison to the volatility of the entire market.
		* We will use yfinance library.
		* How to do it:
			1. Import the libraries
			2. Download the data
			3. Inspect the downloaded data
		* The result is a pd df with 2,769 rows of daily Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices, and the volume.
		* Yahoo Finance automatically adjusts the close price for stock splits and dividends.	
		1. How it works:
			* Though straight-forward, there's a lot of extra functionality.
			* Download multiple tickers at once by providing list of tickers.
			* Download adjusted prices only.
			* Download dividends and stock splits (inline).
			* Disable progress bar.
			* Download in different frequencies, even intraday.
		2. There's more:
			* yfinance offers an alternative for downloading data in the form of a ticker class.
			* The advantage is that this class has more data. ....And it is fascinating...
			* Additional methods: info, actions, major_holders, institutional_holders, calendar, earnings/quarterly_earnings, financials/quarterly_financials
			* For a complete list, visit: https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance
			* There are other libraries, too
	B. Getting data from Nasdaq Data Link
		* Alternative data - anythning that is considered non-market data that reflects a campany's service performance.
		* Alpha - a measure of performance describing an investments strategy's, trader's or portfolio manager's ability to beat the market.
